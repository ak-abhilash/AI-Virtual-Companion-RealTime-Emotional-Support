# AI-Powered Virtual Companion for Real-Time Emotional Support

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an AI-powered virtual companion capable of providing personalized, real-time emotional support and conversations. The system utilizes **multimodal learning** (audio, video, text) and **reinforcement learning** to adapt and respond empathetically to the user's emotional state. Through deep learning models, it can identify emotions, generate context-aware responses, and offer mental well-being support based on user interactions.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Emotion Recognition**: The system processes audio (speech), video (facial expressions), and text data to detect the user's emotional state.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: The AI companion engages in dynamic, real-time conversations and adapts based on the user's emotions and preferences.
- **Adaptive Learning**: The model evolves over time using **reinforcement learning** to continuously improve the quality of support provided.
- **Personalized Support**: Tailored responses based on user preferences and emotional profiles.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly interface where users can interact with the virtual companion through voice or text.
